## How I would like to use svg-to-react-icon-library

step 0: fork the repo
step 1: load the svg file into a pickup folder
step 2: run a command and get the whole library of react icons in the factory folder
step 2.5: run a command and get the dist version of the library
step 3: run a command and get the lookup page
step 4: deploy the lookup page at ease with Nextjs
